# auto-finance
Short script to push data from CSV files and insert into Google Sheets using the gspread library in Python along with the Google Drive & Sheets API. Lightly organized into categories using if statements, although might change it to key value pairs to map 'name' to a category in the future. 

Ultimately, I accomplished the task of automating my finances a bit and also allowing me to get a bit more familiar with Python syntax in advance of the Python course I am starting in late August 2022.
