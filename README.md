# auto-finance
## Description
A short script to pull data from CSV files and push it into Google Sheets using the `gspread` library in Python along with the Google Drive & Sheets API. Lightly organized into categories using if statements, although might change it to key value pairs to map 'name' to a category in the future. 

## Goal
I accomplished the task of automating my finances to give myself a clearer look into my spending as well as getting in a bit more practice with Python.

## Endnotes
