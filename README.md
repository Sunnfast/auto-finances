# auto-finance
## Description
A short script to push data from CSV files and insert into Google Sheets using the `gspread` library in Python along with the Google Drive & Sheets API. Lightly organized into categories using if statements, although might change it to key value pairs to map 'name' to a category in the future. 

## Goal
Ultimately, I accomplished the task of automating my finances a bit and also get in a bit more practice with Python.

## Endnotes
* Current version of the program has personal information redacted.
